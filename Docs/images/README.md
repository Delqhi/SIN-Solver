# Dashboard Preview Image

This directory contains images used in documentation.

## Required Images

| Image | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `dashboard-preview.png` | 1200x800 | Main dashboard screenshot for README |

## How to Generate

1. Start the dashboard: `./start.sh`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3011`
3. Take a screenshot of the main cockpit view
4. Resize to 1200x800 pixels
5. Save as `dashboard-preview.png`

## Alternative: Placeholder

Until a real screenshot is available, the README will gracefully degrade without the image.
