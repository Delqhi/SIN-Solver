# Plan: Delqhi-Platform Pentest & Security Research Integration

## Goal
Make Delqhi-Platform the premier tool for security researchers and penetration testers by providing native bridges for Burp Suite, Metasploit, and dynamic plugin support via Zimmer-08 (SIN-Plugins MCP).

## Architecture
- **Burp Bridge**: A service layer that translates Burp Suite extension requests into Delqhi-Platform commands.
- **Pentest API**: High-performance endpoints optimized for automated tooling.
- **MCP Integration**: Dynamic loading of CAPTCHA-solving logic for unknown/new CAPTCHA types encountered in the field.

## Tasks

### 1. Burp Bridge Service (`app/services/burp_bridge.py`)
- [ ] Implement `BurpBridgeService` class.
- [ ] Support for image processing from Burp Suite extensions.
- [ ] Integration with `SolverRouter` for consensus-based solving.

### 2. Pentest API Endpoints (`app/api/routes/pentest.py`)
- [ ] `POST /pentest/solve`: Primary endpoint for automated tools.
- [ ] `POST /pentest/burp/solve`: Dedicated endpoint for Burp Bridge.
- [ ] `GET /pentest/status`: Pentest-specific metrics.
- [ ] Register router in `app/main.py`.

### 3. Zimmer-08 (SIN-Plugins) Integration
- [ ] Implement MCP client for Zimmer-08.
- [ ] Support dynamic solver registration in `SolverRouter`.
- [ ] Logic to fetch and execute remote plugins for new CAPTCHA types.

### 4. Metasploit Module Template (`scripts/pentest/metasploit_captcha_solver.rb`)
- [ ] Create a Ruby-based Metasploit mixin/module for CAPTCHA solving.
- [ ] Standardized API interaction for Metasploit users.

## Guardrails
- **Security**: All pentest endpoints must require `X-Pentest-Token` or standard API authentication.
- **Performance**: Pentest API must prioritize speed (<2s solve time).
- **Reality**: No mocks. Real connection to Zimmer-08 required.

## Handover
- Once planning and initialization are done, Sisyphus will execute the implementation.
