## SESSION 16 - 2026-01-29T23:51:00Z - PYTHON VERSION FIX & WORKFLOW RE-TRIGGER

**Objective**: Fix Python 3.9→3.11 issue in test.yml GitHub Actions workflow

**Root Cause Identified**:
- File: `.github/workflows/test.yml` (7029 bytes)
- Line 39: `PYTHON_VERSION: '3.9'` ← WRONG
- Reference file: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` uses `PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"` ✅ CORRECT

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Updated test.yml PYTHON_VERSION from 3.9 to 3.11
2. ✅ Added moduleResolution: "node" to captcha-worker tsconfig.json
3. ✅ Added import statement in workflows/index.ts
4. ✅ Committed changes: `de3ff60 - fix: update Python version from 3.9 to 3.11 in test workflow`
5. ✅ Pushed to branch: test/ci-pipeline-verification-complete
6. ✅ GitHub automatically triggered NEW workflow runs

**New Workflow Runs Triggered** (23:50:26-23:50:31):
- Tests run #21498959400 (QUEUED - waiting to start)
- Tests run #21498960879 (PENDING - starting)
- SIN-Solver Tests run #21498959386 (IN_PROGRESS - running)
- SIN-Solver Tests run #21498960875 (IN_PROGRESS - running)
- CI run #21498959388 (queued)
- CI run #21498960877 (queued)

**Status Summary**:
```
OLD FAILURES (before fix - 23:45:01):
  ❌ Unit & Integration Tests (test.yml run #21498843965) - FAILED
  ❌ Test Results Summary (test.yml run #21498843965) - FAILED
  ❌ Dashboard Build (CI run #21498843970) - FAILED
  ❌ Vercel deployment - FAILED

NEW RUNS (after fix - 23:50:26+):
  🔄 Tests workflow #21498959400 - QUEUED (waiting to execute)
  🔄 Tests workflow #21498960879 - PENDING (just triggered)
  🔄 SIN-Solver Tests #21498959386 - IN_PROGRESS (~2-3 min remaining)
  🔄 SIN-Solver Tests #21498960875 - IN_PROGRESS (~2-3 min remaining)
  🔄 CI #21498959388 - QUEUED (Docker builds slow, ~10-15 min)
  🔄 CI #21498960877 - QUEUED (Docker builds slow, ~10-15 min)
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- Tests workflow should now PASS (Python 3.11 available)
- SIN-Solver Tests should continue passing
- CI workflow Docker build should complete successfully
- All status checks GREEN → PR #1 becomes mergeable

**Next Steps** (Auto):
1. Wait for new workflow runs to complete (5-15 minutes)
2. Verify all checks are passing
3. Merge PR #1 to main branch
4. Phase 15.1 complete ✅

**PR Status**:
- URL: https://github.com/Delqhi/SIN-Solver/pull/1
- State: OPEN
- mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED (until new tests pass)
- Last updated: 2026-01-29T23:51:00Z
