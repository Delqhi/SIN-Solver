## Summary

| Model | Type | Status | Training Time | Images |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Text OCR | ddddocr | failed | 0.00s | 0 |
| Math OCR | ddddocr | failed | 0.00s | 0 |
| Audio | Whisper | failed | 0.00s | 0 |

## Model Details

### Text OCR Model
- **Type:** ddddocr
- **Location:** `/Users/jeremy/dev/SIN-Solver/models/text_ocr_model`
- **Purpose:** Text CAPTCHA character recognition
- **Status:** ✅ failed

### Math OCR Model
- **Type:** ddddocr
- **Location:** `/Users/jeremy/dev/SIN-Solver/models/math_ocr_model`
- **Purpose:** Math equation recognition and solving
- **Status:** ✅ failed

### Audio Transcription Model
- **Type:** OpenAI Whisper (base)
- **Location:** `/Users/jeremy/dev/SIN-Solver/models/audio_whisper_model`
- **Purpose:** Audio CAPTCHA transcription
- **Status:** ✅ failed

## Notes

1. ddddocr uses pre-trained models optimized for CAPTCHA recognition
2. For production use, consider fine-tuning on specific CAPTCHA datasets
3. Audio CAPTCHA requires actual audio files for effective training
4. All models saved without modifying existing YOLO classifier

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test models on real CAPTCHA challenges
- [ ] Integrate with solver service
- [ ] Monitor accuracy in production
- [ ] Collect feedback for model improvement
